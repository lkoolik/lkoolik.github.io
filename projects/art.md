## Arts and Crafts

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy finding crafty projects to work on, with a focus on sustainability where I can. Below are a few of my recent projects that I am proud of.

### Crochet
I'm definitely still a beginner, but I'm really enjoying making wearables (especially to help hide my e-bike helmet hair).
* Bandana using yarn from local reuse craft store (featuring a surprise color gradient!)
* Granny square headband

### Embroidery
My goal is to use embroidery and needlework to upcycle and repair old clothing. 
* Charli XCX-inspired baby clothes
* Boston MBTA-inspired baby clothes
* Hole repair on sweater

### Chess Set
I wanted to upcycle some of the tile samples my parents' business often throws away, so I combined them with some medium density fiber board and created a chess board. I then crafted each of the pieces out of clay.
