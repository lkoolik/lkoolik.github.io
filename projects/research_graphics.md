## Research Graphics

I am passionate about designing easy-to-understand graphics for my research talks. Below are a few examples of my graphics. Please feel free to use them with proper attribution.

### Slide Template
I take a lot of pride in my Powerpoint presentation format. I have saved a UC Berkeley-themed template deck on my [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BjEPyJyxJjpy68SjDzuis9cBn-pb9psQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102404854361369621684&rtpof=true&sd=true). Please provide proper credit if you use it.

### Custom Icons for Air Pollution Policy Research

I have drawn a number of icons for use in my research talks. These graphics are saved as PNGs on my Github repository, but I have SVG and illustrator files for further customization available via email.

#### Computer Modeling

### InMAP Methodology
The following images help visualize the [InMAP Source-Receptor Matrix](https://zenodo.org/records/7548607) created by Chris Tessum et al.

I designed this graphic to show how there are individual layers of the InMAP Source Receptor Matrix (ISRM) for each pollutant.

I designed this graphic to illustrate how a fine-scale resolution model like InMAP can be trained by the parameters from a lower-spatial resolution model like CMAQ or WRF-Chem.

I generated this map in Python to help show the irregular grid over the [California ISRM](https://zenodo.org/records/7548607).
