## Libby H. Koolik

### About Me
Hi, I'm Libby! I am an air pollution engineer who works on systems-level solutions for complex, multifaceted environmental problems at the intersection of climate, health, and equity. 

Currently, I'm PhD candidate at University of California, Berkeley, focusing on air pollution exposures in the Department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://ce.berkeley.edu/). Prior to starting at Berkeley, I got my bachelor's in [Atmospheric Science](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) and my master's in [Environmental Engineering](https://cee.mit.edu/) at MIT. In between, I worked as an Air Quality Consultant at [Ramboll](https://ramboll.com/services-and-sectors/environment-and-health/air-quality-management). At Berkeley, I am part of the [Apte Group](https://apte.berkeley.edu/). 

I investigate the structural linkages driving climate and air pollution inequality and identify new frameworks for mitigating environmental injustices. My research is interdisciplinary, bringing together atmospheric science, data science, public health, and environmental justice.

My work is motivated by principles of equity, justice, and inclusion. I am passionate about lowering the barriers of entry to traditional air pollution modeling; as the lead engineer of the [ECHO-AIR model](https://echo-air-model.github.io/), I have built a simple hands-off platform for air pollution modeling. 

For more detailed information about my academic and research experience, check out my online [CV](https://lkoolik.github.io/CV/).
