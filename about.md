## Libby H. Koolik

### About Me
Hi, I'm Libby! I am a PhD candidate at University of California, Berkeley, studying air pollution exposures in the Department of [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://ce.berkeley.edu/). Prior to starting at Berkeley, I got my bachelor's in [Atmospheric Science](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) and my master's in [Environmental Engineering](https://cee.mit.edu/) at MIT. In between, I worked as an Air Quality Consultant at [Ramboll](https://ramboll.com/services-and-sectors/environment-and-health/air-quality-management). At Berkeley, I am part of the [Apte Group](https://apte.berkeley.edu/). 

My research interests fall at the intersection of atmospheric science, data science, public health, and environmental justice. I am also passionate about lower the barriers of entry to traditional air pollution modeling; as the lead engineer of the [ECHO-AIR model](https://echo-air-model.github.io/), I have built a simple hands-off platform for air pollution modeling. The thrust of my work is motivated by equity, justice, and inclusion.

For more detailed information about my academic and research experience, check out my online [CV](https://lkoolik.github.io/CV/).
